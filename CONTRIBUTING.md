  ```

### C++ Standards

- Use C++20 features and standards
- Follow modern C++ best practices
- Use `auto` for type deduction where appropriate
- Prefer `constexpr` and `const` where possible
- Use RAII principles

### Code Style and Formatting

All source code contributions must strictly adhere to the parrot coding guidelines:

- **clang-format**: Use clang-format for consistent code formatting (configuration provided in `.clang-format`)
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow existing conventions in the relevant file, submodule, module, and project
- **Comments**: Use clear, descriptive comments for complex algorithms or non-obvious code
- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase

#### Formatting Commands

Format git changes:
```bash
# Commit ID is optional - if unspecified, run format on staged changes
git-clang-format --style file [commit ID/reference]
```

Format individual source files:
```bash
# -style=file: Obtain formatting rules from .clang-format
# -i: In-place modification of the processed file
clang-format -style=file -i -fallback-style=none <file(s) to process>
```

Format entire codebase (for maintainers only):
```bash
find . -name "*.hpp" -o -name "*.cu" -o -name "*.h" | grep -v build | grep -v _deps \
| xargs clang-format -style=file -i -fallback-style=none
```

#### Code Quality Guidelines

- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code to preserve maintainability and readability
- Avoid committing commented-out code
- Ensure the build log is clean (no warnings or errors)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex algorithms or non-obvious code

### CUDA Specific

- Use `__host__ __device__` annotations appropriately
- Ensure CUDA kernels are efficient and follow CUDA best practices
- Test on multiple GPU architectures when possible

### Adding or Modifying Functionality

When adding or disabling functionality:

- **CMake Options**: Add a CMake option with a default value that matches existing behavior
- **File Inclusion**: Where entire files can be included/excluded, modify `CMakeLists.txt` rather than using `#if` guards around entire file bodies
- **Minor Changes**: For minor changes to existing files, use `#if` guards appropriately
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure changes maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking

Example CMake option:
```cmake
option(PARROT_ENABLE_FEATURE "Enable new feature" ON)
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Best Practices

Try to keep pull requests (PRs) as concise as possible:

- **Single Concern**: Each PR should address a single concern when possible. If there are several unrelated fixes needed, consider opening separate PRs and indicating dependencies in the description.
- **Clean Code**: Avoid committing commented-out code or debug statements.
- **Descriptive Titles**: Write commit titles using imperative mood and reference the Issue number.

### Commit Message Format

Follow this recommended format for commit messages:

```
#<Issue Number> - <Commit Title>

<Commit Body>
```

Example:
```
#123 - Add support for custom reduction operations

This commit adds support for user-defined reduction operations
in the fusion_array class, enabling more flexible data processing
workflows.
```

### PR Workflow

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the upstream parrot repository and clone your fork
2. **Create Branch**: Create a feature branch for your changes
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes following the coding guidelines
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all tests pass and the build is clean
5. **Push to Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository
6. **Create PR**: Open a pull request against the appropriate upstream branch
7. **Mark WIP**: If still working on the PR, prefix the title with `[WIP]`
8. **Address Reviews**: Respond to reviewer feedback and make necessary changes
9. **Final Review**: Wait for final approval from parrot engineers

### PR Requirements

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows formatting guidelines (`clang-format` applied)
- [ ] Build is clean with no warnings or errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] SPDX license headers included in new files
- [ ] Related GitHub issue exists and is referenced

### Review Process

- At least one parrot engineer will be assigned for review
- PRs will only be accepted after adequate testing has been completed
- The corresponding issue will be closed when the PR is merged
- Complex changes may require multiple review cycles

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Add unit tests for all new functionality
- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- Use the doctest framework for testing
- Ensure tests pass on multiple GPU architectures

### Test Categories

- `test_basic`: Basic operations and functionality
- `test_math`: Mathematical operations
- `test_reductions`: Reduction operations
- `test_scans`: Scan operations

./test_math
# etc.
```

## Documentation

All new components must contain accompanying documentation describing the functionality, dependencies, and known issues.

### Documentation Requirements

- **New Features**: All new functionality must include comprehensive documentation
- **API Documentation**: Use Doxygen-style comments for all public APIs
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples for new features or complex functionality
- **README Updates**: Update README.md for significant changes or new components
- **Known Issues**: Document any limitations or known issues

### Code Documentation Standards

- Use Doxygen-style comments for public APIs:

   * @brief Brief description of the function
   * @param param1 Description of parameter 1
   * @param param2 Description of parameter 2
   * @return Description of return value
   * @throws std::exception Description of when exceptions are thrown
   */
  ```
- Document function parameters and return values
- Provide usage examples for complex functions
- Include performance considerations where relevant

### User Documentation

- Update relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Add examples to the `examples/` directory for new features
- Update the README.md for user-facing changes
- Ensure documentation builds without warnings

### Building Documentation

```bash
# Install documentation dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
